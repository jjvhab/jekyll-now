Swath profiles are a popular method for examining the topographical character of a region: 
they represent generalized profiles of a landscape section.

The function [swathR](https://github.com/jjvhab/swathR) for the R programming language calculates the data that is necessary for the creation of a swath profile. 
In contrast to other solutions (e.g. the QGIS-plugin swath profile (Krambach 2015) or Hergarten et al. 2014), the values are
extracted along a given straight line ('baseline'; see Fig. 2, black line). Thereby the function does not allow the detailed 
investigation of geomorphologic features like rivers. Nevertheless, we encourage users to consider the significance of the 
differences between a polyline and a straight line (defined by beginning and end point): in many cases the straight line 
(together with the right parameters) will produce a swath profile that is nearly as informative as the polyline. It always 
depends on the accuracy that is required in your specific case (cf. Sommerfeld 2010).

***Fig. 1:** Example swath profile with median (black) and quartiles 25 and 75 (grey) of elevation data (metres). The data was acquired using swathR.*

The function requires the following input:

+ x- and y-coordinates of beginning and end point (Fig. 2, red dots)
+ raster file with elevation data (or the data you want to examine)
+ CRS-string of the used reference system (points and raster have to be referenced in the same system)

It allows the setting of the following parameters:

+ number of lines on each side of the baseline
+ distance between lines
+ method of value extraction (see extract() function of raster package)

***Fig. 2:** Visualization of swath-principle. The parameters of swathR change the number of and the distance between red lines.* 


The following output is generated:

+ a matrix with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quantile (25%) and quantile (75%) values along the generalized section
+ a spLines object of the generated lines
+ the extracted raw data

The output generation includes all values along the generated lines. This is CPU-intensive but allows the output of the aggregated raw data for debugging and transparence.

The benefit of swathR lies in the simple and on-the-fly applicability. The generated information can directly be used for plotting or further calculations in R.

Nevertheless there are possible improvements for future versions:

+ polyline support
+ reduction of CPU usage


The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jjvhab/swathR).
